# Investor Tool

This is a tool to screen stocks from the Brazilian stock market, based on some
famous investing strategies.

## Full description

This project was done for didatic purposes (I wanted to learn Flask).
It scrapes stock market information from www.fundamentus.com.br, applies some filters to those stocks,
depending on a user defined strategy. Those strategies can be selected from an interactive interface
created with Flask. Once the strategy is selected, the page gives a list of stocks that match the strategy's criteria. The final result is hosted on http://arthurmello.eu.pythonanywhere.com/investor-tool.
This is for didatic purposes only, and does not constitue a serious stock recommendation.
